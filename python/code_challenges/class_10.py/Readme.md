# Stacks and Queues
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Challenge
Define pop, push, peak and isempty for stack and enqueue, dequeue, peak and isempty for queue.

## Approach & Efficiency
Pop O(1)
Push O(1)
Dequeue O(1) When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

Peek O(1) : When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

IsEmpty O(1) Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty
