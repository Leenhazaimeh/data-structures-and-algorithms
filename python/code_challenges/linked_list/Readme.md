# Singly Linked List
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Approach & Efficiency
can be viewed as a link or pointer to another node,  singly linked list is a linked list where each node is an object that stores a reference to an element and a reference, called next, to another node
